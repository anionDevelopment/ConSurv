# Color-System Specification

## Purpose

Records how the colors of a product with a user-interface are defined and applied, independent of the technology the
user-interface is built with (for example Flutter or Angular). They are not derivable from the source-code itself:

- They state that the colors have one single source of truth - the color-palette - so that the appearance of the
  product can be changed in one place and a component can never disagree with the rest of the user-interface about
  what a color is.
- They state that there is one palette per theme-mode, a light one and a dark one, so that both modes are defined
  deliberately instead of one of them being an afterthought that drifts out of sync.
- They state that the design-system is Material 3 and that the palettes are applied through it, so that every
  component and every page follows the palette automatically instead of each one being styled by hand.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The colors of the user-interface have a single source of truth

All colors of the user-interface SHALL be defined in the color-palette and nowhere else. The palette SHALL be the
single source of truth for color: no component, page, widget, stylesheet or template SHALL define a color of its
own. Changing the appearance of the product SHALL be possible by changing the palette alone.

#### Scenario: A component needs a color

- **WHEN** a component, page or widget needs a color for text, a background, an accent, a border or any other purpose
- **THEN** it reads that color from the palette (through the theme) instead of naming a color-value of its own

#### Scenario: A color-value is defined outside the palette

- **WHEN** a color-value (for example a hex-literal or a named framework-color) is defined in a component, page,
  widget, stylesheet or template instead of in the palette
- **THEN** this is a defect, which is resolved by moving the color into the palette and reading it from there

#### Scenario: The appearance of the product is changed

- **WHEN** the colors of the product are to be changed
- **THEN** only the palette is changed, and the change takes effect everywhere in the user-interface without any
  component having to be touched

### Requirement: There is one color-palette per theme-mode

There SHALL be exactly two color-palettes: one for light-mode and one for dark-mode. Both SHALL be defined together
as the single source of truth described above, so that each theme-mode has its own deliberately chosen colors.

#### Scenario: The product is themed

- **WHEN** the colors of the product are defined
- **THEN** there is one palette for light-mode and one palette for dark-mode, and each theme-mode takes its colors
  from its own palette

#### Scenario: A theme-mode is missing a palette

- **WHEN** only one of the two theme-modes has a palette, or the colors of a theme-mode are scattered instead of
  being collected in its palette
- **THEN** this is a defect, which is resolved by defining the missing palette as part of the single source of truth

### Requirement: The design-system is Material 3 and the palettes are applied through it

The user-interface SHALL use Material Design in its version 3 (Material 3) as its design-system, and the light- and
the dark-palette SHALL be applied to the product through the Material theme. Every Material component and every page
SHALL take its colors from the applied palette automatically, so that the palette reaches the whole user-interface
without a component having to apply colors on its own.

#### Scenario: The theme of the product is built

- **WHEN** the theme of the product is built
- **THEN** it is a Material 3 theme built from the two palettes, so that selecting light-mode or dark-mode selects the
  corresponding palette

#### Scenario: A new component is added to the user-interface

- **WHEN** a new component or page is added to the user-interface
- **THEN** it follows the applied palette through the Material theme automatically and does not define colors of its
  own
